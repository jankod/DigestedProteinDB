## Database of trypticly cleaved proteins
CBInr and NCBI Taxonomy databases were used to construct data warehouse containing trypsin cleaved proteins (with 1 missed cleavage allowed). Data warehouse based on Infobright column store was constructed containing all in silico cleaved proteins. It is part of ProteinReader software. 

For optimization of java code was used Jprofiler
